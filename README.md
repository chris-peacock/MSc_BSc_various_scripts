# MSc_BSc_various_scripts
A collection of scripts I wrote during my bachelor's and master's degrees, either for course projects or for summer research

##Resin_curing_monte_carlo
A project for my graduate soft matter course at Dalhousie; simulating a 2D resin curing and shrinking over time

##traFFIC
A side project of mine, where I used a similar approach as the resin curing project to simulate traffic 
jams as a function of the number of lanes on a highway and the range of car speeds

##Mandelbrot
Technicolor Mandebrot set generator, just for fun and visual appeal

##quadratic_fit_error
A script estimating the error introduced when using a Matlab polynomial regression function to fit noisy data
